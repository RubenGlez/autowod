## Quick Start Guide (No Coding Required!)

1. **Fork this repository**

   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page
   - This creates your own copy of the tool

2. **Set up your secrets**

   - Go to your forked repository's Settings
   - Click on "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
   - Add these required secrets by clicking "New repository secret":

     ```
     # Authentication
     EMAIL=your-email@example.com
     PASSWORD=your-password

     # 2Captcha API Key
     TWO_CAPTCHA_API_KEY=your-2captcha-api-key

     # Target Website
     BASE_URL=https://your-gym-website.com
     ```

3. **Set your workout schedule**

   - Still in the repository secrets, add your preferred times for each day:
     ```
     # Schedule (use 24-hour format)
     MONDAY=17:00
     TUESDAY=18:30
     WEDNESDAY=09:00
     THURSDAY=19:30
     FRIDAY=20:15
     SATURDAY=14:30
     SUNDAY=14:30
     ```
   - For days you don't want to book, either:
     - Don't add the day's secret at all, or
     - Set it to an empty value
   - Use 24-hour format (e.g., '14:30' for 2:30 PM)

4. **Optional: Configure booking window**

   ```
   # How many days in advance you can book (default: 7)
   AVAILABLE_DAYS=7
   ```

5. **Get a 2Captcha API Key**

   - Go to [2captcha.com](https://2captcha.com)
   - Register an account
   - Add funds (minimum $3)
   - Copy your API key from your account dashboard

6. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"

That's it! The tool will now automatically try to book your preferred sessions every day at 22:30 (winter) or 21:30 (summer) Spain time.

## Checking if it's Working

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Look for the latest "Daily Reservation" workflow run
3. Click on it to see the details and logs
4. A green checkmark means it ran successfully

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not running?**

2. **Login fails?**

   - Double-check your EMAIL and PASSWORD secrets

4. **Wrong booking times?**
   - Make sure you're using 24-hour format (e.g., "17:00" not "5:00 PM")
   - Check if the day's variable is set correctly (e.g., "MONDAY=17:00")
